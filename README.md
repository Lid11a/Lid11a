## Hi, I'm Lidiia 👋

I work on machine learning and data science projects.  
I focus on building end-to-end ML solutions — from data analysis and model selection to reproducible pipelines and inference services.

Currently open to machine learning and data science roles.

### 🚀 Key projects

#### 🔹 Loan payback prediction — end-to-end ML system  
Binary classification project demonstrating a full ML workflow from research to production-style deployment.

**Highlights:**
- statistical and exploratory analysis (EDA, clustering exploration, hypothesis testing)  
- model benchmarking and final LightGBM selection  
- business-driven threshold selection (FPR-constrained)  
- reproducible training pipeline with MLflow tracking  
- FastAPI inference service packaged with Docker  
- offline feature drift monitoring using PSI  
- automated testing (pytest) and CI (GitHub Actions)

#### 🔹 House price prediction — regression modeling and analysis  
Tabular regression project focused on statistical analysis, feature behavior understanding, and systematic model comparison.

**Highlights:**
- deep statistical feature and target analysis  
- log-transformed target modeling aligned with the RMSLE evaluation metric  
- cross-model benchmarking  
- demonstration that regularized linear models outperform boosting on sparse tabular data
